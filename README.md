# [GrabMac](http://grabmac.mkaiser.io)

The administrative backend for our Databases project. (CS 336)
Our project was based around an iOS app made by [Neil](https://github.com/NeilHussain). The app serves as a social media network for Mac and Cheese lovers, allowing them to search for restaurants selling Mac and Cheese, invite friends to a Mac Meetup, and post to the Mactivity Feed.

This administrative backend is targeted towards restaurant owners to view statistics gathered from the app. Useful metrics are queried and displayed, such "Mac and Cheese Sold per Hour/Month", "Top Eaters", "Most Popular Mac Dish", and more.
